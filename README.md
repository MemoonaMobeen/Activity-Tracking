 Getting Started:
 
 
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation. To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run npm install from the root. After this you will run npm run-script install-all from the root. From now on run this command anytime you want to install all modules again. This is a script we have defined in package.json .

This app can be deployed directly to heroku since there is a script defined in package.json which will automatically handle building and deploying the app. For more information on deploying to heroku reference the extra resources at the bottom of this file.

Let us understand what does MERN stack means.
Mongo DB – It’s an open-source NoSQL cross-platform document-oriented database.
Express JS – It’s a web-based application framework work with Node JS, It helps to build web apps and RESTful APIs.
React– React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. React is a User Interface (UI) library. React is a tool for building UI components
Node JS – It is a free JavaScript run-time environment, It executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, and Unix.

I will be using the following plugins and tools to create the MERN Stack app.
Node JS
MongoDB
Mongoose JS
Express JS
ReactJS
Visual Studio Code
